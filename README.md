Inventory and Billing System
Overview
This is a console-based Inventory and Billing System developed in C++ for managing items, generating bills, and performing basic inventory operations. The program allows users to add, display, edit, and delete items, as well as generate bills based on available stock. It uses file handling to persistently store item data in a text file (items.txt) and includes predefined sample data for testing.
The system is designed for small-scale inventory management, such as in a store or shop, and provides a simple interface for tracking items and calculating costs with tax and discounts.
Features
Add Item: Add a new item to the inventory with details like item number, name, manufacturing date, price, quantity, tax, and discount.

Display Items: View all items currently stored in the inventory with their details.

Edit Item: Modify the details of an existing item by providing its item number.

Delete Item: Remove an item from the inventory using its item number.

Generate Bill: Create a bill by selecting items and specifying quantities, with automatic stock updates and total amount calculation.

Persistent Storage: Item data is saved to items.txt and loaded automatically when the program starts.

Predefined Data: Includes 10 sample items for immediate use upon first run.

Requirements
Operating System: Windows (due to the use of windows.h and console cursor functions like gotoxy).

Compiler: Any C++ compiler supporting standard libraries (e.g., GCC, MSVC).

Libraries: Standard C++ libraries (iostream, fstream, vector, etc.) and Windows-specific headers (windows.h, conio.h).

How to Use
Setup
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

Compile the Code:
Use a C++ compiler like g++ or an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).

Example command with g++:
bash

g++ main.cpp -o inventory_system

Run the Program:
Execute the compiled file:
bash

inventory_system.exe

On first run, the program creates items.txt with 10 predefined items if the file doesn’t exist.

Usage Instructions
Upon running the program, you’ll see a menu with the following options:
Add Item:
Enter details for a new item (e.g., item number, name, date, price, etc.).

The item is appended to items.txt.

Display Items:
Lists all items with their details (item number, name, date, price, quantity, tax, discount, and net amount).

Edit Item:
Provide the item number of the item to edit and enter new details.

Updates the item in items.txt.

Delete Item:
Enter the item number to remove it from the inventory.

Generate Bill:
Select items by their item number and specify quantities.

The program checks stock availability, updates quantities, and calculates the total cost (including tax and discounts).

Displays a formatted bill with item details and the total amount.

Exit:
Closes the program.

Navigation: After each operation, press any key to return to the main menu.

File Structure
main.cpp: The source code file containing the entire program.

items.txt: A text file generated by the program to store item data. Created automatically with sample data on first run.

Sample items.txt Format
Each line represents an item with the following space-separated fields:

itemno name mm dd yy price qty tax dis netamt

Example:

1 Rice 01 01 2024 50 100 5 10 4500

Functions in the Code
gotoxy(int x, int y): Moves the console cursor to the specified coordinates (Windows-specific).

item Class:
add(): Prompts user input for item details.

calculate(): Computes the net amount based on price, tax, discount, and quantity.

show(): Displays item details.

saveToFile(): Writes item data to a file.

loadPredefinedItems(): Initializes items.txt with 10 sample items if it doesn’t exist.

displayItems(): Reads and displays all items from items.txt.

editItem(int ino): Edits an item by its item number.

deleteItem(int ino): Deletes an item by its item number.

generateBill(): Handles billing, stock updates, and total calculation.

Limitations
Platform Dependency: Works only on Windows due to windows.h and conio.h.

Input Validation: Minimal error checking; assumes valid user input.

File Handling: Uses basic text files, which may not scale well for large inventories.

Console-Based: No graphical user interface (GUI).

Future Improvements
Add input validation for robustness.

Support cross-platform functionality (e.g., remove Windows-specific code).

Implement a database (e.g., SQLite) instead of text files for better scalability.

Add a GUI using libraries like Qt or SFML.

Include search functionality to find items by name or other attributes.
